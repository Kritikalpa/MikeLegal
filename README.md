- Dynamic CSS (eg. scss) is a plus.
- Redux for state management.
- Can use Material UI.
- Can use Graph API for implementing graphs.
- Freedom to use any Demo Api (eg. jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

## Area of focus
- Application design.
- Component design.
- Styling.
- Code quality.
- Responsiveness.

## Libraries Used
- React.
- SCSS.
- Material UI.
- ChartJS.
- Mocki API.

## To be done:
- Unit and e2e test (good to have).
- Memory optimization (react-query).

### Note:
- Redux wasn't used in this assingment as there was no need for a global state management library.
- Completed 2/5 cards as rest were similar and involved working with static data.
